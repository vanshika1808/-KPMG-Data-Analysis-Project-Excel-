# -KPMG-Data-Analysis-Project-Excel-
Using **Microsoft Excel**, I analyzed KPMG’s customer and transaction dataset to uncover business insights and trends.   The analysis involved cleaning raw data, preparing it for use, and building dashboards for decision-making.

## Dataset Description
The project used four datasets provided by KPMG:

1. **Customer Address Dataset**  
   Contains customer location details such as state, country, postcode, and property valuation.

2. **Customer Demographic Dataset**  
   Provides customer details including gender, DOB, wealth segment, job category, tenure, and purchase history.

3. **Transactions Dataset**  
   Includes purchase transactions with product details, order type, brand, product line, cost, and list price.

4. **New Customer List Dataset**  
   Contains potential customer information (demographics, address, valuation, and rank).
